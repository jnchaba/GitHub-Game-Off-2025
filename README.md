# Working Title: Signal Match
*A Wave‑Tuning Puzzle Game for Game Off 2025*

## Overview
This repository contains the early prototype of a wave‑matching puzzle game submitted to the Game Off 2025 game jam (theme: **WAVES**). The core mechanic centers around tuning, manipulating, and matching waveform patterns in real time.

## Development Log
I am experimenting with creating a dev log for this project.
- You can read it on the [itch.io page for this game](https://jnchaba.itch.io/signal-match).

### Jam Info
- **Jam:** Game Off 2025 (hosted by GitHub & Lee Reilly) ([itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025))
- **Theme:** WAVES
- **Submission period:** 1 Nov 2025 – 1 Dec 2025
- **Platform / Engine:** [Godot 4.5.1](https://godotengine.org/)

## Prototype Focus
The initial deliverable is a minimal, focused prototype built to validate the core wave‑matching interaction. It includes:
1. A tunable waveform (via UI controls) drawn and animated on‑screen.
2. A target waveform for the player to match.
3. A timed challenge where the player must match the waveform within a time limit to succeed.
